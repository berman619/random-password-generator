# Password Generator Starter Code

## Project Description
This is a random password generator created for an assignment in the Columbia Coding Boot Camp. The password generator uses JavaScript to dynamically update the HTML. It presents the user with a series of prompts to determine the character length of the generated password and what character types are included. The generated password is then displayed as text on the screen. 

While working on this project, I referenced materials from the Columbia Coding Boot Camp, W3 Schools, MDN Web Docs, Udacity, and freeCodeCamp.
